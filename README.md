# Javascript Homework 3
Required to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. 

## Goal:
The goal was to use what we learned in the first week of javascript to create a functioning password generator using the guidelines.

## Issues:
- More research needs to be done in order to use arrays and .math along with functions correctly. 

## Results:

Even though I was able to execute some prompts, write variables, and execute the syntax used for functions. My generator did not work correctly.

## Summary:
This assignment was challenging. The process for creating functions is a totally new concept and I need to practice more.
